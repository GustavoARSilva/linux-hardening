# Gustavo A. R. Silva - Core Infrastructure Initiative Public Presentations

## Kernel Recipes 2017 - Fixing coverity bugs all around the Linux kernel

Coverity scans the kernel code and reports issues that can hide coding mistakes and vulnerabilities. It reports around 6,000 outstanding defects in the Linux kernel, some of which were identified 11 years ago. I’m dedicated to fix those defects and this is a presentation about my work. I’m looking forward to getting your feedback as I’m looking for ways to improve my workflow and also helping others to get started with kernel hacking.
