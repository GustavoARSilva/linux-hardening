# Core Infrastructure Initiative Public Presentations by Gustavo A. R. Silva

## Kernel Recipes 2019 - Hunting and fixing bugs all over the Linux kernel

At a rate of almost 9 changes per hour (24/7), the Linux kernel is definitely a scary beast. Bugs are introduced on a daily basis and, through the use of multiple code analyzers, *some* of them are detected and fixed before they hit mainline. Over the course of the last few years, Gustavo has been fixing such bugs and many different issues in every corner of the Linux kernel. Recently, he was in charge of leading the efforts to globally enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough; which appears by default in Linux v5.3. This presentation is a report on all the stuff Gustavo has found and fixed in the kernel with the support of the Core Infrastructure Initiative.

## Kernel Recipes 2018 - A year of fixing Coverity issues all over the Linux kernel

Coverity is a static analyzer that scans the kernel code and reports issues that can hide coding mistakes and vulnerabilities. Currently, it reports around 5,000 outstanding defects in the Linux kernel. I’m dedicated to fixing those defects and, this talk is a status report of the work I have been doing over the course of a year. Lessons learned, as well as the most common types of issues reported, will also be presented. [[slides]](https://embeddedor.com/slides/2018/kr/kr2018.pdf)

## Kernel Recipes 2017 - Fixing coverity bugs all around the Linux kernel

Coverity scans the kernel code and reports issues that can hide coding mistakes and vulnerabilities. It reports around 6,000 outstanding defects in the Linux kernel, some of which were identified 11 years ago. I’m dedicated to fix those defects and this is a presentation about my work. I’m looking forward to getting your feedback as I’m looking for ways to improve my workflow and also helping others to get started with kernel hacking.
